        <h1>My Interests</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>Swimming</b> is one of my favorite things to do! The typical
              events I swim is the 100 back and 200 freestyle. I swim on the
              parks and recreation team, along with my high school varsity team,
              and am the head captain. On top of swimming, I enjoy teaching
              children how to swim, and coaching older kids on the parks and rec
              team. I also work as a lifeguard at my hometown pool.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> <b>Drawing</b> is really fun as I can let my creativity fly. I
              prefer drawing with pencil, as I frequently need to erase </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> <b>Programming</b>, working with many different programming
              languages. I even programmed this! My favorite language to work
              with due to versatility, is Java. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> <b>Painting</b> is a more recent find of mine, and is a big way
              how I relax when I'm really stressed. It's therapeutic in its own
              way. I love to paint landscapes but also animals, and find people
              really hard to paint. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> <b>Music</b> is a big hobby of mine. I love playing music and
              listening to music. I play 3 instruments: flute, piccolo, and
              piano along with singing. Some of my favorite artists and bands to
              listen to are AJR, Jax, and Aerosmith. I am a Spotify lover all
              the way. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Spending time with my dogs </b> which includes running around with them, sleeping with them, and petting them. They are so sweet and love us so much. My dogs' names are Toby and Nala; Toby 3 years old and Nala 6 years old. Both can be anxious dogs, but they still love us all the same.
